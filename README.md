# token-tx

Bridge service to faciliate Ethereum token transfers.

A hosted instance is available on Heroku: [https://token-tx.herokuapp.com](https://token-tx.herokuapp.com/).

## Flow

![Transaction Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kern/token-tx/master/resources/flow.png)

1. Transaction Sender creates a new session with its public key
2. Bridge Server returns the URL for the session (`data.href`)
3. Transaction Sender sends the session URL to the intended Transaction Receiver (such as via SMS)
4. Transaction Receiver updates the session with its wallet address
5. Transaction Sender polls the session for updates to the wallet address
6. Transaction Sender receives the Transaction Receiverâ€™s wallet address and signs a transaction to send the token
